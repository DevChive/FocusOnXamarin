# dotNETConf - FocusOnXamarin

This is the sample app that I showed at the dotNETConf - Focus on Xamarin event on the 23rd of March, 2020. It was part of my session titled **Building Beautiful Apps with Xamarin.Forms** and shows off the following things:

- Custom fonts
- Animation
- Page transitions
- Use of styles
